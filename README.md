# Bank Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes banking marketing data to identify distinct customer segments and their propensity to subscribe to term deposit products. Using K-means clustering and other advanced techniques, I discovered 6 distinct customer segments with subscription rates ranging from 2.2% to 48.6%.

## Data
The analysis uses the Bank Marketing dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing information from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

## Techniques Applied
- Customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Comparison with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Feature importance analysis
- Marketing efficiency metrics

## Key Findings
- Identified two high-value segments representing only 11.2% of customers but generating 38.1% of all subscriptions
- Discovered a 22x difference in conversion rates between best and worst-performing segments
- Found engagement quality (call duration) more predictive than contact frequency
- Developed segment-specific marketing recommendations for improved ROI

## Tools Used
- R for data analysis and visualization
- tidyverse, cluster, factoextra, and other R packages
- R Markdown for reproducible reporting
